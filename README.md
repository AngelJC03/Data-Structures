# Data-Structures

This Data Structures repository is dedicated to demonstrate my implementation and understanding of some standard data structures. 

This repository may be used as a study guide to anyone looking to deepen their understanding in data structures and can be used as an exmple implementation for an understanding of the algorithms used in these data structures. 

The data structures implementation will feature four files, a header file, a source file, a "main" source file, and an output text file. The header file will be used to create the classes and methods for these data structures. The source file will be used to define the methods. The "main" source file will contain the "main" function which outputs the results into an output file typically named after the data structure it is demonstrating. 
  
The following data structures will be implemented in this repo:  

Dynamic Array  
Linked List  
Hash Table (three different methods of handling collision)  
Binary Search Tree 
Red-Black Tree (balanced binary search tree)  ***UNFINISHED*** <br>
Adjacency Matrix (Weighted, Directed Graph) <br>
Adjacency List (Weighted, Directed Graph)
  
The languages featured in this repository: <br>
Python  
Javascript  
C++
