# Data-Structures

This repository is going to be dedicated to my custom standard data structures. Within these data structures, I will feature my understanding of the algorithms for traversals, removals, searching, and inserting methods. I will also be featuring multiple sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.   
  
My purpose in writing custom data structures is to strengthen my understanding in the algorithms used within the programs. This will help further develop my problem solving skills and approaches when I encounter one.   
  
The following data structures will be implemented in this repo:  
  
Dynamic Array  
Linked List  
Hash Table (three different ways of handling collision)  
Binary Search Tree  
Red-Black Tree (balanced binary search tree)  
Weighted Graph  
Unweighted graph  
  
These data structures will be implemented in one of three languages to demonstrate my proficiency in each:  
  
Python  
Javascript  
C++  
  
Each data structure will feature its designated main.cpp file. Within this file, all methods showcasing the algorithms' uses will be called. The output file, labeled "data structure"output.txt, will contain a standard output to help visualize the data structure after each method has been called, as well as descriptions as to what operation has most recently been performed.
