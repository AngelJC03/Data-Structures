# Data-Structures

  This repository is going to be dedicated to my custom written data structures. Within these data structures, I will feature my understanding of the algorithms for traversals, removals, searching, and inserting methods. I will also be featuring multiple sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc. 
  
  My purpose in writing custom data structures is to strengthen my understanding in the algorithms used within the programs. This will help further develop my problem solving skills and approaches when i encounter one. 
  
  In my main.cpp file, I demonstrate how these methods are called and how you can use the return values.
