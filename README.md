# Data-Structures

  This repository is going to be dedicated to my custom written data structures. Within these data structures, I will feature my understanding of the algorithms for traversals, removals, searching, and inserting methods. I will also be featuring multiple sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc. 

  The purpose of writing these data structures is to strengthen my understanding in the algorithms used within the programs. This will help me further develop my problem solving skills and approaches for solving problems.
